<h3>Central Data Storage</h3>
<p>The Central Data Storage function of the Virtual Pneumatic Laboratory program is achieved by a Java servlet program
 and a database server. (Only version above Server version has this function, see <a href="register.htm">regiser</a>.)
The servlet program running in a servlet container (Apache Tomcat) is connected to the database server (mySQL database server)
The Virtual Pneumatic Laboratory program, as a Java application or as a Java applet, is connected to the servlet to operate on the data
in the database server.</p>

<p>The functions of the "Database" menu are shown below:</p>

<p>Login : Login servlet program to access database server.</p>

<p>New : Start a new design and save the old one.</p>

<p >Open : Load a old circuit design from database server.</p>

<p >Save : Save the current circuit design to the database.</p>

<p >Delete : Delete a circuit design in the database.</p>

<p >Save as : Save the current circuit design to the database with a different name.</p>

<p >Import : Load a circuit design from the database and add it to the current design.</p>

<p >Export : Save the selected circuit to the database.</p>

<p >First, user login to the servlet program. Then, he can perform other functions, like open,
save, delete, save as,import,export, with his own identity. He can only access his own data.
<p>Administrator can access all user's data and manage a common data area for all users' access.</p>
