<h3>Circuit Analysis and Animated Simulation</h3>

<p>After electrical circuit design, animated simulation is used to verify the correctness of the design.
To enter simulation mode, user clicks on the "Simulation\Simulation" function in the pull-down menu.
Before start simulation, the program will analyze the electrical circuit first. If any circuit connection error occurs,
the program will show the error message and return the program to the edit mode.
User can use "Simulation\Analysis" function in the pull-down menu to execute electrical circuit analysis.</p>

<p>Once the program enters simulation mode, manual buttons for the control system 
will show up in the push button or choice button electrical devices in the electrical device windows. 
User use these button to start the control, switch settings, or emergently stop. </p>

<p>During the simulation process, user can clicks on the "Simulation\Stop" function to stop the simulation at any time
and return to the edit mode.</p>
