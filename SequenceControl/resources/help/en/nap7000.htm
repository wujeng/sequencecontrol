<p>
NAP7000 is a remote data acquisition system. 
It is connected to a computer through a RS232 port. 
Module I-7520 transfers RS232 signals into RS485 signals (see Figure above). 
Different kinds of data acquisition modules can be plugged in the RS485 signal lines. 
Up to 256 modules could be used without a repeater. 
Every module has its own address. 
The computer and module are in a master/slave relation. 
Computer sends command to a certain module, and the module responses. 
Module can be set at different baud rate. Checksum can be used to insure the data correction.
