<P>The user interface of the Virtual Pneumatic Laboratory program mainly consists of the following items, 
(as shown in the figure above):</P> 
<OL>
  <LI><A href="pulldown.htm">Pull-down Menu</A>:<br>Click on submenu item to perform certain function.
  <LI><A href="devices.htm">Device Pools</A>¡G<BR>Switch to different device pools to pick up an appropriate device. 
  <LI>Circuit Panel:<BR>When user clicks on certain pneumatic device, an instance object of that pneumatic device will 
show at the up-left
cornor of the Circuit Panel. Then, user can drag it to other place.
  <LI>Status bar:<BR>Show some information or operation indication.
  <LI>Popup Menu:<br>
When user right click on circuit panel ,device symbols or connection lines, a appropriate popup menu will show up.
User can perform different functions under different situations.

<P>The usage of Virtual Pneumatic Laboratory program is really simple and intuitive.
Generally speaking, the operations of pneumatic control circuit design consists following steps:</P> 
<OL>
  <LI><A href="pickpdevice.htm">Pick up pneumatic device</A>:<BR>
All pneumatic devices are shown in different device pools with their device symbols. User clicks on certain symbol to use that
device. An instance of that device symbol will show in circuit panel. User can right clicks on the device symbol in the circuit panel 
to operate on the device.
  <LI><A href="line.htm">Connect different devices</A>:<BR>
User clicks on a port of certain device symbol in the circuit panel to draw out a line. Then, he clicks on a port of another device to 
form a connection line.
  <LI>Use combination of devices:<BR>
There are some combinations of pneumatic devices in the cascade method pool. They are device packages 
for pneumatic sequential control design with cascade method.</LI></OL>
