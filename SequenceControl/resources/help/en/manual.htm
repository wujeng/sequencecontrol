<center><h3>WebLadderCAD Web-based computer-aided sequential control design software</h3></center>

<p>The complete WebLadderCAD product consists of three parts:<br>

<ol><li><A href="vlab.htm">Virtual Pneumatic Laboratory</A>¡G<br>
The Virtual Pneumatic Laboratory part is a web-based computer-aided pneumatic circuit design software.
User picks pneumatic devices and connects them to form pneumatic control circuit. The results are simulated by the
program automatically.
       <li><A href="ladder.htm">WebLadderCAD</A>¡G<br>
Based on the Virtual Pneumatic Laboratory program, WebLadderCAD provides additional electrically controlled system and 
electrical devices to form a web-based sequential control design software. The program helps users design electrical circuit to control
 pneumatic system and electrically controlled system. The circuit design can be translated to PLC codes of different PLC model. 
The effects of the control circuit are animatedly simulated by the program.
       <li><A href="remote.htm">Web-based Sequential Controller</SPAN></A>¡G<br>
Based on the WebLadderCAD program, Web-based Sequential controller use remote data acquisition modules to sense input signal
 and provide output action. It can be used as a local-side PC-based Sequential Controller or a remote-side Web-based Sequential controller.</li>
