<h3>Computer-aided Sequential Control Design</h3>

<p>A introduction on sequential control is shown <a href="sequential.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=643 height=450 src="..\Images\ecad.JPG"></p>

<p>WebLadderCAD is a web-based computer-aided sequential control design software based on the <a href="vlab.htm">Virtual Pneumatic 
Laboratory </a> program. Pneumatic actuator (piston or motor) and some electrically controlled devices (alarm, conveyer,...) are used 
as controlled systems which are shown in pneumatic circuit panel. 
WebLadderCAD provides electrical devices, electrical valves, connection wires so that user 
can design electrical circuit for the sequential control of the system in the pneumatic circuit panel (see the figure above).

<p> Use the &quot;Electrics/Ladder&quot;  Menu function to open electrical circuit design windows. </P> 

The WebLadderCAD software has the following features:
<ul><li>Visualized controlled components.<BR>
Besides the pneumatic system, some electrically controlled components can be chosen to setup a controlled system.
       <li>Visualized electrical devices.<br>
This software provides some electrical devices, which can be used to form an electric circuit.
       <li><a href="ecad.htm">Computer-aided design</a>.<br>
This software helps user design electric circuits with clicks and drops of a mouse.
       <li><a href="auto.htm">Computer automatic design</a>.<br>
This software helps user input motion sequence required with clicks of a mouse. Then, the software can design electric circuit automatically according to the requirement.
      <li><a href="simulation.htm">Circuit analysis</a>.<br>
This software can analyzes the circuit and point out wrong connections if any exists.
       <li><a href="simulation.htm">Animated simulation</a>.<br>
This software simulates the motion of the controlled systems according to the circuit design.
       <li><a href="plc.htm">PLC codes</a>.<br>
This software can translate the electric circuit into codes of different models of PLCs.
       <li><a href="udefine.htm">User-defined components</a>.<br>
By providing some proper data, user can edit certain preformatted file to add components to the program.
       <li>Web reachable.<br>
With a Java-enabled browser, user can access the software in any place at any time. There is no installation problem.
       <li><a href="database.htm">Data storage</a>.<br>
In this software, users can save their design results in a database on a remote site.
       <li><a href="multiuser.htm">Collaborative mode</a>.<br>
The software can be used in collaborative mode. Many users can design a common pneumatic circuit collaboratively.

<p>
The execution environment of the software is shown in the figure above. 
First of all, the software is a Java applet and is also a Java application. 
It can be used in any computer with Java virtual machine, or it can be embedded into web page for web access by a browser. 
It consists of various kinds of software components and provides basic functions of a computer-aided software.
</p>
<p>
When the software is used as an application, user can save his data in local computer. 
Otherwise, user can save his design result in a remote database. 
The function of data storage in a database is accomplished with the assistance of Java servlets. 
Java servlets in a  web server are used to coordinate data access of a database through JDBC connections 
and applet-servlet communications are used to transfer data between applets and servlets.
</P>
<p>
In order to provide collaborative function, a collaborative server is used in the web server computer. 
The collaborative server manages messages among many computer-aided design programs running in collaborative mode. 
These messages include user operation messages, chat messages, and token management messages. 
The collaborative server is also written in Java.
