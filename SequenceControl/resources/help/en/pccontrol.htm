<h3>PC-Based Sequential Control</h3>

<p>
The control part of the sequential control software is integrated into WebLadderCAD in the "control" menu. 
The control part of the software is designed to satisfy following requirement:<br>
<ol><li>User can perform local-side sequential control.
        <li>User can perform remote-side sequential control.
        <li>Control results can be monitored locally or remotely.
        <li>Local-side and remote-side use the same program.
</ol>

Due to noisy industry enviroment, industry personal computer is used as controller for its reliability. 
The Web-based sequential controller uses central control design. Only remote data acquisition modules are exposed to the noisy 
enviroment. The controller could be made of regular personal computer.

<p>The "control" menu of Web-LadderCAD is shown here:<br>

<p> When user wants to perform PC-based sequential control, he clicks on the "Control/Server" function in the pull-down menu
to enter server mode. Then, he clicks on "Control/Hardware" function to scan through RS232 port to 
get the information of <a href="nap7000.htm">NAP7000 remote data acquisition modules</a> which are online.
He then executes "Control/Grab Control" to get control right. 

<p> Then, he has to <a href="assign.htm">assign</a> input/output connections. If the input/output mapping is correct,
he finally can click on "Control/Start" menu to start control action.</p>
<p> During the control action, he can click on "Control/Stop" menu to stop the control action anytime.</p>

<p >Web-based Sequential Controller can be used in remote sequential control and monitoring. 
The server program could be accessed by many client programs at the same time. Whoever wants to perform control action must get
control right first. The client program which does not have the control right can only monitor the control result.
