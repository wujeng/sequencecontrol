<P>Virtual Pneumatic Laboratory is a web-based computer-aided pneumatic circuit design software. 
it has following functions:
<ol>
<li><A href="cad.htm">Pneumatic circuit computer-aided design</A>:<BR>
The program helps user pick pneumatic devices and connect them to form pneumatic control circuit. 
All devices are represented by device symbols.
  
<li>Animatedly simulation:<BR>
All devices in the circuit are simulated all the time. 
<li> <A href="database.htm">Central data storage</a> (Server version, see <a href="register.htm">register</a>):<BR>
All users' circuit design data can be stored in a database with the usages of a web server and a database server.
<li> <A href="multiuser.htm">Collaborative design</A>(Collaborative version, see <a href="register.htm">register</a>):<BR>
 Working with a collaborative server, this software can let many users design circuits at the same time collaboratively.
  <LI><A href="udefine.htm">Devices provided by user</A>:<br>
With appropriate pneumatic device symbols, user can edit a configuration file to add new devices into the program.
