<h1>Sequential Control</h1>
<p>During the past years, electronics has had a dramatic progress especially in manufacturing. 
The advance of electronics makes chips more popular and cheap. 
Microprocessors are used in almost every mechanical system. 
Mechanics and Electronics are combined to produce Mechatronics that integrates 
the power part of mechanical system and the control and signal processing ability of electronics to form a flexible working unit.
<p>Functionally speaking, a sequential control system can be separated as two parts: one is power part, 
which supplies energy to produce mechanical work. The other part is control part, 
which provides control signals to activate drivers. 
The control part is made of pure mechanical components in the early day and later replaced by electrical circuits. 
Then, due to the population of microprocessors, the control part is now made of computer.
<p>With electric circuits for control, the reliability of the system is improved, 
but the circuit design is still not flexible. Every change of motion sequence involves new circuit design and hardware wiring, 
which is time consuming. So, microprocessors come in here. 
A specific purpose controller called programmable logic controller (PLC) was introduced into industry. 
With PLC, we can change motion sequence by just modifying programs (digital circuit) without changing any hardware wiring.
<p>Although the electrical circuits are replaced by PLC, the design of electrical circuits is still very important. 
Because the major design method of PLC programming is to translate electrical circuits (ladder diagram) into PLC codes.
<p>With microprocessors in sequential control system, PLC was first used. 
PLC is a special purpose computer, which is designed for logic operation of data. 
Because of its reliability and low price, it is very popular in Industry in the past decades. 
But, a PLC is a close system; every manufacture of PLC has its own design and format of PLC. This makes PLC evolve slowly.
<p>In the mean while, personal computer with its open structure has evolved several generations in hardware and software. 
The progress of manufacturing technology in electronics has made the PC-based control affordable. 
And the prosperity of software engineering makes the development of large-scale program in PC far easier than in PLC. 
In these years, the Internet grows rapidly. Networking becomes one of the basic functions of personal computer. 
This makes PC even more superior than PLC in the era of network.
<p>Furthermore, in the era of network many devices could be used as a sequential controller. 
Them could be PLC, PC, pocket computer, PDA, cell phone, ... 
A sequential controller must at lease be accessible from these devices.
<p>In order to handler the complexity of large-scale software, object-oriented programming was proposed in the past years. 
Today object-oriented programming has come to a mature state and visual development tools are popular in developing software. 
Java is called network language, because of its platform independence and enhancement in networking. 
Today, it is not only era of PC-based control but also era of web-based control. 
Soon people will use a PDA to activate a sequential control. Software in Java has its merit in this environment.
