<p>The elements of the interface (see figure above) are listed in the following.
<ol><li><a href="epulldown.htm">Pull-down menu</a>:<br>
       <li><a href="edevices.htm">Devices pools</a>: <br>
Pneumatic devices and electrical devices are grouped into different kinds of device pools.
       <li>Controlled system panel:<br>
The pneumatic circuit panel [5] of the computer-aided pneumatic circuit design software is used as controlled system panel. A user can setup a controlled system here.
       <li>Electrical circuit panel:<br>
The electrical circuits designed by users are shown here graphically.
       <li>Electrical device panel:<br>
Electrical device panel shows all electrical devices used to design the electrical circuit.
       <li>Motion sequence window:<br>
In this window, the software helps user input motion sequence with clicks of a mouse.
       <li>PLC code window:<br>
PLC code window used to show PLC codes according to the electrical circuit.
      <li>Status bar:<br>
A little usage tip is shown here.
</ol>

<p>
Usually, the procedure of sequential control design in this software is stated as following:
<ol><li><a href="setup.htm">Setup controlled system</a>.<br>
User setups a pneumatic system controlled by electric valves and chooses some electrically controlled devices to form a controlled system.
       <li>Pick electrical devices wanted: <br>
User picks electrical devices wanted to design circuit from electrical device pools. Devices chosen are shown in electrical device panel.
       <li>Design electric circuit:<br>There are two ways to create electrical circuit:
          <ul><li><a href="designcir.htm">Computer-aided design</a>: <br>
                 User clicks on device symbols of the electrical devices in electrical device panel and picks wire from wire pool to form electric circuit.
                  <li><a href="auto.htm">Computer automatic design</a>:<br> 
User inputs motion sequence and chooses operation condition and let computer designs the circuit.
         </ul>
       <li><a href="simulation.htm">Circuit analysis and animated simulation</a>.<br>
User can enter simulation mode, and observe the motion of the controlled system and state changes of electric devices to understand the correctness of the design. Through animated simulation, user can figure out where is the problem. Then he can modify the circuits until correct design is reached.
