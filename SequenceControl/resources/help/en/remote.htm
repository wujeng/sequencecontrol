<h3>Web-based Sequential Controller</h3>

<p> Since we have a CAD software with simulation function, 
if we add a simple digital input and digit output card in the computer, 
then we can perform PC-based sequential control.
But, with simple I/O card the controller can only be used as a local controller. 
In that case it will not be able to compete with PLC regarding cost and it will be a waste of computing power of PC. 
Therefore, in this sequential controller, the WebLadderCAD software is integrated with
 a remote data acquisition system (NAP7000) to form a central controller.
<p>
Currently in factory automation, mostly people use distributed control. 
Local machines are controlled by PLC or dedicated controller. 
Local controllers send local data to a central computer by network. 
The central computer can monitor and send command to local controller if necessary. 
All control jobs are done in local side. 
The central computer is only responsible for data display and transmission. 
But in this research the sequential controller is designed as a central controller. 
Local data is picked up and transmitted to the controller by data acquisition modules. 
All control algorisms are computed in the central controller. 
Then, control commands (control signals) are sent to local output modules to drive local machines. 
The computation burden of central controller is much heavier than that of distributed control. 
But many local modules are much cheaper that local controllers. 
The total cost will be much cheaper for central control. 
Since in our sequential controller there is no computation intensive job, like servo motor control, 
a personal computer will be enough.

<p>Web-based Sequential Controller consists of a <a href="ladder.htm">computer-aided sequential control design software</a> 
and <a href="nap7000.htm">remote data acquisition modules</a>.
It helps user design electrical circuits for sequential control, 
simulate the motion of the controlled system according to the circuit design, 
perform PC-based control and monitor the control results remotely. 
The controller can be used in any place where sequential control is needed, like factory automation, home security system, ... 

The controller software is a Java application and Java applet. 
It can be used in any computer with Java virtual machine. 
Therefore, the controller can be implemented in Windows or Linux system.

<p>The Web-based Sequential Controller is used with client/server structure (see figure above).
Server-side program is running in a server controller. 
A client-side program which is connected to the server-side program can perform remote sequential control and monitoring.
The server-side program and client-side program are the same program. 
When a program is running in server mode, it is a server-side program.
When a server program first enters server mode, it will scan for NAP7000 remote data acquisition modules to find out 
what modules are online and builds mirrors of them in the program. Then, a thread is created to keep update date between modules
and their mirrors.
When a program is running in client mode, it is a client-side program.
When a client program enters client mode, it will connect to the server program, read modules information in the server program, 
and build modules mirror in the client program. Then, socket connection keeps update modules information between server program
and client program.</p>

<p>The general processes of using this controller are stated in the following:
<ol><li><a href="setup.htm">Define controlled system in the software</a>.<br>
Pick up different controlled devices (software components) to form the controlled system. The controlled system will be shown in a window.
       <li><a href="ecad.htm">Design electrical circuit</a>.<br>
Use electrical devices (software components) to design electrical circuit or input required motion sequence and ask the program to design electrical circuit automatically.
       <li><a href="simulation.htm">Simulate motions</a>.<br>
Let the program simulate the motions of the controlled system according to the circuit design and make correction if necessary.
      <li><a href="pcControl.htm">Perform PC-based sequential control</a>.<br>
Set the software in server-side control mode and detect the remote data acquisition system to get all modules. The program will create and show module mirrors. Setup connections between electrical devices and modules input/output points. Perform hardware wiring. Then, get the privilege to control and start the control action.
      <li><a href="pcControl.htm">Perform remote control or remote monitoring</a>.<br>
After server-side controller is set up, User can use a remote computer to run the same sequential control software, put it in client-side control mode to get the information of the data acquisition system on server-side through a socket connection. Then, if he can get the control privilege, he can upload/download circuit design and start control action. Otherwise, at least he can monitor the situation of the real controlled system on server-side.
