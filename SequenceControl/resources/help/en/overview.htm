<center><b>WebLadderCAD Overview</b></center>
<p>WebLadderCAD is a web-based (collaborative) sequential control computer-aided design 
and computer automatic design software. It let user setup a controlled system, pick electric devices, visually design electric circuits for sequential control. 
User can also input a motion sequence requirement and ask the software to design electric circuits for him. 
<p>The software is not only a design tool but also an educational tool. It is a a Java application and Java applet, which can be embedded into web pages to form course material for Pneumatics, Sequential Control, or PLC.
The software can be used in any computer with Java virtual machine. 
It can be access by a browser. The users by web access can save their design results in a database.
<p>The software can be used in collaborative mode through the Internet. 
In collaborative mode the person that gets the token dominates the design process. 
The others can see the design result in their own computers. 

<p>This software has the following functions:
<ol><li>Visualized controlled components.<br>
Besides the pneumatic system, some electrically controlled components can be chosen to setup a controlled system.
      <li>Visualized electrical devices.<br>
This software provides some electrical devices, which can be used to form an electric circuit.
     <li>Computer-aided design.<br>
This software helps user design electric circuits with clicks and drops of a mouse.
    <li>Computer automatic design.<br>
This software helps user input motion sequence required with clicks of a mouse. Then, the software can design electric circuit automatically according to the requirement.
     <li>Animated simulation.<br>
This software simulates the motion of the controlled systems according to the circuit design.
     <li>PLC codes.<br>
This software can translate the electric circuit into codes of different models of PLCs.
     <li>User-defined components.<br>
By providing some proper data, user can edit a preformatted file to add components to the program.
     <li>Web reachable.(Server register, see <a href="register.htm">register</a>)<br>
With a Java-enabled browser, user can access the software in any place at any time. There is no installation problem.
     <li>Data storage.(Server register, see <a href="register.htm">register</a>)<br>
In this software, users can save their design results in a database on a remote site.
    <li>PC-based sequential control.(Control register, see <a href="register.htm">register</a>)<br>
Remote data acquisition modules with RS232/RS485 interface are integrated with the software to form a sequential controller.
    <li>Web-based sequential control.(Control register, see <a href="register.htm">register</a>)<br>
With a web server in the computer, the PC-based sequential controller becomes a Web-based sequential controller. 
Remote user can design control circuit, upload circuit, activate the control and monitor the control through a web browser.
    <li> Collaborative mode.(Collaborative register, see <a href="register.htm">register</a>)<br>
The software can be used in collaborative mode. Many users can design circuits collaboratively.
</ol>
 
<p>The complete WebLadderCAD product can be regarded as having three parts: (also see <a href="register.htm">register</a>)
<ol><li><a href="vlab.htm">Virtual Pneumatic Laboratory</a>.<br>
Virtual Pneumatic Laboratory is a web-based computer-aided pneumatic circuit design software. 
User chooses pneumatic devices from device pools, connects the devices to form pneumatic circuits. 
Pneumatic devices are animatedly simulated in the usage of this software. 
From the animated simulation, user knows the correctness of the design and is able to further modify the circuits.
<li><a href="ladder.htm">WebLadderCAD</a>.<br>
Based on the Virtual Pneumatic Laboratory program, 
WebLadderCAD provides some electrically controlled components and  some electrical devices, 
which can be used to form an electric circuit. 
Besides, some functions are added to make WebLadderCAD become a web-based (collaborative) sequential control computer-aided design 
and computer automatic design software.
<li><a href="remote.htm">Web-based Sequential controller</a>.<br>
Remote data acquisition modules are integrated with WebLadderCAD to form a web-based sequential controller.
