![PneumaticLab](PneumaticLab.jpg "Pneumatic Lab")

PneumaticsCAD is a computer-aided pneumatic circuit design software.
The software is developed in Java and is an Eclipse project.

To start the program, use command:

java tw.com.justiot.pneumatics.PneumaticsCAD

This software allows user to conduct pneumatic circuit design by

(1) picking the circuit components on menu bar to draw the pneumatic devices,

(2) moving the devices to proper positions and connecting the devices with signal lines (pipes),

(3) filling in the parameters for all the devices.

(4) the simulation of the designed circuit is Automatically applied.
